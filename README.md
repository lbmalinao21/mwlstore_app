Challenges Faced & Solutions
1. State Management for Cart Functionality
Challenge: Managing cart items and ensuring real-time updates across screens.


Solution: Implemented a simple singleton-like CartManager class to hold and manage cart data. Used setState to trigger UI updates.


2. Passing Data Between Screens
Challenge: Efficiently passing product data to the Product Detail screen.


Solution: Used Flutter's Navigator.pushNamed with arguments to pass product objects cleanly to detail pages.



 Conclusion
The MWL Store UI Project successfully demonstrates a fully functional e-commerce front-end interface using Flutter, focusing on clean UI/UX design principles, modular components, and efficient navigation flow.
